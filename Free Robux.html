    <p id="Q1"><u>WHAT IS ROBLOX?</u></p>
    <p id="Body">
        Roblox is an online platform and storefront where users go to play games. Roblox is not a game, it is a place where people play games made by other developers. In this sense, it is more similar to PC platform Steam than it is to any online children’s game.

        What makes Roblox different from anything else in the games industry — including a storefront like Steam — is that all the games are made by its users. On Roblox, the fun doesn’t just come from playing games, it also comes from making games. These games are not formally developed by Roblox Corporation, but by users of the platform. Currently, the official website boasts that its users have published over 20 million games on the platform.

        In Roblox, Free Robux is hard to come by, so it makes sense that players are always on the lookout for ways to earn more. If you want to upgrade your avatar, buy special abilities, or take advantage of many other features, you’re going to need some. But since the Builder’s Club was changed into a paid subscription, getting Robux without opening your wallet has become almost impossible. There are still plenty of ways to earn them, however, and at least one way to get them free.
